# Design With TypeScript & Go 🚀

This repository is a daily record of my journey learning and implementing system design concepts, data structures, and design patterns. Each topic is implemented in both **TypeScript** and **Go** to compare and contrast the approaches in different paradigms.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- [x] 01 - [LRU Cache](./01-LRU-Cache)

## 🛠 How to Run

### Go
To run the Go implementation:
```bash
go run <path-to-file>.go
```
Example:
```bash
go run 01-LRU-Cache/main.go
```

### TypeScript
To run the TypeScript implementation, you can use `ts-node`:
```bash
npx ts-node <path-to-file>.ts
```
Example:
```bash
npx ts-node 01-LRU-Cache/main.ts
```
